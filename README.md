👋 Hi, I’m @smithdesigner

💻 I’m a Computer Science graduate student interested in backend and systems-oriented software engineering, with a focus on performance, reliability, and correctness.

🌱 I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at DePaul University, where I’ve worked on systems programming, concurrency, and data structures.

⚙️ I’m especially interested in Linux-based environments, backend infrastructure, and learning how large-scale systems are built and operated.

🤝 I’m open to collaborating on hackathons and technical projects.

🔧 Languages: Python, Java, C | Environment: Linux
